#UWPHelper
UWPHelper is a set of useful UWP tools such as converters, triggers, custom controls and helpers. Currently the [xCalculator][1] app and some other apps that are coming soon use it.

> It's just a Shared Project for good usability when changing its code but I could make it a NuGet package if someone will be interested.
